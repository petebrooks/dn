  p.block I feel oppressed by biology. I have no use for it: my genes, like all queer genes, cannot be proliferated by its impoverished means. I may have no use for it, but it needs me for its totalizing system to work: it is trying desperately to find a spot for me with its evolutionary psychology, epigenomics, and chromosomes. We explained out otherness (sexuality, race, disability) on moral grounds; now we try to explain in otherness through science. Thank god science can tell us we’re all the same, subject to its commandments and stories. However, I believe that the scientific method cannot access our orgasms, that a gene cannot explain homosexuality, and that while sexual reproduction explains the process of evolution, evolution cannot explain the origins of sexuality. The scientific project is not a project of understanding in the empathic sense; it is a project of understanding in the rational sense. Science– and its confederate, medicine– must shape, either physically (i.e. through surgery, medication.) or conceptually (i.e. through the creation of disorders, symptoms) all bodies and phenomena to fit its taxa, lest its system collapse. In my art, I hope to propose a new bio-scientific paradigm that understands, in the empathic sense, and allows the realization of non-conforming organisms and organisms that seek to de-conform.

  p.block My making is my way of reproducing myself in the world. I pierce, stitch, mold, and stuff myself into my work. I frequently work with leather; a material only shades away from body and living– flesh made consumer, but no longer consumable. Leather also, quite literally, contains the visceral; it is a material with the ability to both entice and disgust. Often I combine leather with plastic, foiling the two materials by placing the synthetic, translucent qualities of plastic against the fleshy, occluding qualities of leather. Plastic can become a material metonym, not only physically present in the object, but as ‘adjective-plastic’ (as in plastic surgery) as well, indicating the infinitely malleable. These materials and their connotations allow me to augment the overdetermined body with the potentialities of technological intervention. I hope to turn science’s own dichotomous key (and lock!) against itself and create models for new bio-scientific practices based upon speculation and accretion. In my work, I want to create revolutionary surgeries for amputees and additees, combinatory processes for conceiving babies with n-parents, and new phyla of post-op gender unassigneds with bespoke genitalia.
