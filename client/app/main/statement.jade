 p.block I’ve found a particular locus of frustration with my own identity and biology. As a gay man, I am incapable of reproduction. I am trying, and failing, in my art to affect this condition. I see my art as activist art fighting against the hegemony of science and biology, forces I see as unchallenged oppressors of queers today. We’ve gone from explaining out homosexuality via moral grounds, to ways of explaining in homosexuality via science. I believe that science cannot access our attractions, orgasms, and affective bonds, that a gene cannot explain homosexuality, and that while sexual reproduction can explain the process of evolution, evolution cannot explain the origins of sexuality. I want to stake the ground in this scientific lacuna, and make a new resting point for queer identities.

 p.block My making is my way of reproducing myself in the world. Each object I make is a sensual act; I pierce, stitch, and stuff myself into my work. Often, I inviting my audience to rest upon, use, or otherwise violate a work’s status as an art object. In these ways, my work becomes a site of not only contemplation, but bonding as well. I often work with leather because of its myriad cultural valences; it is a material often eroticized and associated with particular uses allowing me to draw in these connotations. Leather also, quite literally, contains the visceral; it is a material with the ability to both entice and disgust. This quality makes it especially suited to exploring sexuality: that inexplicable force that perpetuates us; that which vacillates between condemnation and celebration; and the fundamental of humanity that science, society, and politics seeks to explain, regulate, and legislate, but will not engage with.
